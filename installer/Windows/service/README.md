The second vital requirement for installing this service on windows is the `installutil.exe` utility which is provided with Microsoft.Net runtime. 


[ FROM [MICROSOFT WEBSITE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/sd8zc8ha(v=vs.110).aspx) ]

`If youâ€™re using the Visual Studio command prompt, InstallUtil.exe should be on the system path. If not, you can add it to the path, or use the fully qualified path to invoke it. This tool is installed with the .NET Framework, and its path is %WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework[64]\<framework_version>. For example, for the 32-bit version of the .NET Framework 4 or 4.5.*, if your Windows installation directory is C:\Windows, the path is C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe. For the 64-bit version of the .NET Framework 4 or 4.5.*, the default path is C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe.`


Most windows systems that Red5pro is designed to run on already have some version of Dot Net installed. If a particular system does not have Dot net or has a version older than `3.5`, You can always install version `4.5` or newer the latest runtiem from its [official page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=42642)
